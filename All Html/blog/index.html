        <h2>Three-Tier Architecture</h2>
        <p>In web development, the Three-Tier Architecture is a design pattern that divides an application into three interconnected layers: Presentation (User Interface), Application (or Business Logic), and Data.</p>

        <h3> (1)Presentation Tier (User Interface):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the topmost layer that directly interacts with users.</li>
            <li>It is responsible for presenting information to users and handling user inputs.</li>
            <li>Typically, this tier includes user interfaces like web browsers, mobile apps, or desktop applications.</li>
        </ul>
     
        <h3> (2)Application Tier (or Business Logic Tier):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the middle layer of the architecture where the application logic resides.</li>
            <li>It processes and manages data, implements business rules, and performs calculations or other operations required for the applicationâ€™s </li>
            <li>TThis tier acts as a bridge between the presentation tier and the data tier.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> (3)Data Tier:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the bottom layer where data is stored and managed.</li>
            <li>It usually includes databases or other data storage systems where information is persisted.</li>
            <li>This tier is responsible for storing, retrieving, and updating data as requested by the application.</li>
        </ul>
